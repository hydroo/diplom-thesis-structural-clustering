call-matrix [options] <tracefilename> [processes-to-be-compared]

	processes are space separated and can be singular or a range in the form of 1-5

	options:
		-p                          list processes
		-f                          list functions
		-%                          show loading progress

		--console                   raw console output [default]
		--vis                       gui visualization
		--transitive-vis            gui visualization of the transitively closed matrix
		--group <min-similarity>    prints a list of groups of similar processes. similarity ranges between 0.0 and 1.0
		--simple-similarity         prints the compressed simple similarity matrix
		--subsumption-similarity    prints the compressed subsumption similarity matrix
		--compressed-dot            prints the compressed call matrix as graphviz dot format
		--compressed-transitive-dot prints the compressed transitively closed call matrix as graphviz dot format
		--compressed-cxt            prints the compressed call matrix in the cxt format
		--compressed-transitive-dot prints the compressed transitively closed call matrix in the cxt format
